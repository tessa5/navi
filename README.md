# Sticky Navigation
I wanted to make a simple sticky navigation with a profile kind of page set up because I could not make it work even after watching a lot of tutorials. This is simple, i hope it will be helpful to some start up developers, and i welcome changes.
## 
basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and Java Script. This is supported by all IDE's.
### Prerequisites
No prerequisites needed but it is safe to download Java Script files that are hosted online.
